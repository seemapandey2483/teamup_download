      <h3>Download Mode</h3>
      <p>There are several ways to get your download through TEAM-UP.</p>
      <ul>
        <li> A scheduled process is available that can run &quot;unattended&quot; 
          at any time day or night. This mode requires that your machine be turned 
          on and logged in at the time the download is scheduled to run</li>
        <li>You can choose to run your download in an &quot;on-demand&quot; mode. 
          If you choose to do this, TEAM-UP can put ICONS on your desktop to make 
          this easier for you. An icon is available that will automatically get 
          your download file by double clicking on the icon (you don't even need 
          to log in). </li>
        <li>You can also add an icon to your desktop that will bring you to the 
          login screen. This is handy for getting to your archive file or performing 
          some other action other than the daily download.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>TIP: You can schedule an automatic download and add both icons to your 
        desktop. (You can also add any of these options later through the application 
        screens).</p>
