<UL>
  <LI>download individual transactions from the archive</LI>
  <LI>request archive resubmissions online</LI>
  <LI>retrieve on-line reports</LI>
</UL>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ...all without changing your daily workflow!

  <LI><FONT color="red"><B>Wait for the "Continue" button to appear at
	the bottom of this page. (You may need to scroll down to see the bottom

  <LI><B>Important information for Windows XP Service Pack 2 users.</B>
    You must click on the Information Bar at the top of this page. It reads, 
    <i>"This site might require the following ActiveX control : 'TEAM-UP' from 
    'Ebix,Inc.' Click Here to install..."</i> Please click 
    on the Information Bar and choose <i>"Install ActiveX Control."</i>  When 
    the security warning message appears, click on More Options and choose 
    <i>"Always Install software from Ebix,Inc."</i> Click 
    the Install button.<BR>&nbsp;</LI>
  <LI>If prompted with a dialog box asking if you would like to download and 
    install a control, please click "<B>always trust controls from Ebix,
