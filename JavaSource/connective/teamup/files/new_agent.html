<p><TEAMUP:CarrierName> is upgrading to a new download system in order to better serve you, our agents.  We have attempted to make the transition as seamless as possible to keep from interrupting your daily schedule.  However, we will need for you to complete a quick, one-time setup and registration.</p>

<p>Please <a href="<TEAMUP:RegistrationUrl>" title="click here to install"><font color="red"><b>click here</b></font></a> to install TEAM-UP Download.  If you are already using TEAM-UP Download with other companies, the installation process will automatically detect and skip parts of the installation.  You will <i><b>not</b></i> lose any information or settings when adding a new company to the download process.</p>
